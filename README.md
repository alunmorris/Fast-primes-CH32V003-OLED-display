# Fast-primes-CH32V003-OLED-display
Finding all primes starting at 3,000,000,000. The gap between the primes is about 22 at this magnitude. The CH32V003 8-pin RISC-V 32 bit processor runs at 24MHz and finds about 23 primes a second using a fast deterministic Millerâ€“Rabin algorithm. An LED on PC4 is flashed for each prime found.
The display is a 128x32 OLED.
